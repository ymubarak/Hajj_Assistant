# Hajj_Assistant

## Inspiration

Every year, pilgrims face many problems in the communication and guidance, more detailed:
- People experiencing pilgrimage for the first time, exhibiting lack of knowledge about different aspects of Hajj.
- The wide variety of Hajj rituals details that are usually hard to remember. 
- The urging need of personal guides throughout the Hajj to acquire different information about different places.
- Many of the pilgrims cannot read the guidelines due to language differences or their inability to read.

## What it does

- It's a wearable smart headphone device with a GPS module that takes speech inquiries through an embedded microphone. It recognizes the content of the query and responding with the relevant reply; this includes information about the current location, useful information about the holy texts and transcripts related to the sacred places the pilgrim visits. 
- It tracks the user's Hajj journey step by step to provide information about what's next.
